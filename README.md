# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Overview:
This repository provides a beginner-friendly guide to performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Roller-coaster dataset using Python's pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries. EDA is a crucial step in any data analysis project as it helps to understand the structure of the dataset, identify patterns, anomalies, and relationships between variables.

Dataset Description:
- The Roller-coaster dataset used in this tutorial contains information about various roller-coasters around the world.
- It includes attributes such as the roller-coaster name, park name, location, height, length, and number of inversions.
- The dataset aims to provide insights into the characteristics of different roller-coasters and their distribution worldwide.

Tools Used:
- Pandas: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library in Python, used for loading, cleaning, and manipulating the dataset.
- Matplotlib: A widely used plotting library in Python for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- Seaborn: Built on top of matplotlib, seaborn provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

Contents:
- Installation: Instructions on how to install the required libraries and set up the environment.
- Loading the Dataset: Code snippets demonstrating how to load the roller-coaster dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
- Data Cleaning: Techniques for handling missing values, removing duplicates, and dealing with outliers.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Statistical summaries, distribution plots, and correlation analysis to understand the characteristics of the roller-coaster dataset.
- Visualization: Various types of plots and visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn to gain insights into the data.
- Conclusion: Try to answers the questions about data and find potential next steps for further analysis.

Getting Started:
To get started with the Exploratory Data Analysis on the Roller-coaster dataset, follow these steps:
- Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
- Install the required libraries mentioned in the requirements.txt file using pip or conda.
- Open and run the Jupyter Notebook (Exploratory_Data_Analysis_Roller_Coaster.ipynb) in your preferred Python environment.
- Follow along with the explanations and execute the code cells to perform EDA on the dataset.
